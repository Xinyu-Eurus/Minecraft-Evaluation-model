Please put the "models" folder under the same directory with "parser_and_classifier_2.py". 

Please build the test data folder as following structure: 

<test data> (e.g. "./test-data/test-12-26") (under the same directory with "parser_and_classifier_2.py")
	/trace
		(put all worker trace json files here)
		(they start with "trace_worker...")
	/survey
		(put all manager survey json files here)
		(they start with "surveyTrace_...")



To run the "parser_and_classifier_2.py", please input 2 paramaters to indicate the input/output file path.
sys.argv[1]: path of <test data> (e.g. "./test-data/test-12-26")
sys.argv[2]: path of the output json (prediction results and features, default named "features.json"). 
Use "-" for the second parameter if you want the output json "features.json" under the same path of test data.

e.g. (run in the terminal command line)
	$ python ./parser_and_classifier.py ./test-data/test-12-26 -
Then one file named "features.json" will be generated.


To run the "json2csv.py", please input 1 paramater.
sys.argv[1]: path of <test data> (e.g. "./test-data/test-12-26")

e.g. (run in the terminal command line)
	$ python ./json2csv.py ./test-data/test-12-26
Then one file named "fea_m_compare.csv" will be generated under path of <test data>.




Others informations:
demo_data.npy is one episode of demo data collected from the player.
The size and features are as the descriptions.pdf shows.
The "models" folder includes 7 models:
	* km_0.model to km_4.model is for kmeans clustering of feature[0] to feature[4];
	* RF-origin.model is the random forest model trained by original data-label pairs;
	* RF-optim.model is the random forest model trained by optimized data-label pairs, the average accuracy in testing is usually 0.01-0.03 higher than RF-origin.model.
