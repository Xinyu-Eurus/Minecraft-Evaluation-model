demo_data.npy is one episode of demo data collected from the player.
The size and features are as the descriptions.pdf shows.
The "models" folder includes 7 models:
	* km_0.model to km_4.model is for kmeans clustering of feature[0] to feature[4];
	* RF-origin.model is the random forest model trained by original data-label pairs;
	* RF-optim.model is the random forest model trained by optimized data-label pairs, the average accuracy in testing is usually 0.01-0.03 higher than RF-origin.model.
